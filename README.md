# Leopard## DescriptionLeopard is an open source mesh processing solution for grasshopper that allows users to interact with rhino geometry and create customised mesh shapes. By selecting Mesh vertices, edges and faces, users have more freedom to edit meshes intuitively and use different subdivision schemes to selectively choose multiple areas to fix.Mesh data using [Plankton][plankton] for internal processing.Leopard is still in the very early development stage, so please use it for your own risk and we welcome any feedback or discussion(insight) you may provide.Leopard Â© 2016 Gene Ting-Chun Kao and Alan Song-Ching Tai[plankton]: https://github.com/meshmash/Plankton
